## Submission Checklist

Before submitting, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Complete Report**: All sections filled out with sufficient detail
- [ ] **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, and demonstrations included
- [ ] **Code**: Well-named(based on task and whether it is an attack or a fix) and well-commented and organized in your GitHub repository deliverable directory of the corresponding assignment
- [ ] **Tests**: Security and functionality tests implemented after fix
- [ ] **GitHub Link**: Repository link included in report and Brightspace submission
- [ ] **Academic Integrity**: All sources properly cited, work is your own

**Submission Instructions**:
1. Save this report as PDF: `[StudentID]_Assignment[X]_Report.pdf`
2. Submit PDF to Brightspace
3. Include your GitHub repository fork link in the Brightspace submission comments
4. Ensure your repository is private until after course completion otherwise you'll get zero grade

**Final Notes**:
- Use **GenAI** for help but do not let **GenAI** to do all the work and you should understand everything yourself
- If you used any **GenAI** help make sure you cite the contribution of **GenAI** properly
- Be honest about limitations and challenges
- Focus on demonstrating understanding, not just working code
- Proofread for clarity and technical accuracy

Good luck!
